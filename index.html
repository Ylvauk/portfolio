        <p class="p-bio">
            Hi I'm Taylor Sturgill. I'm an aspiring software engineer who has always had an interest in most things computer related. This probably comes from the fact that ever since I was given a computer when I was six I've been glued to it and I look forward to learning as much as I can about different coding language along with other skills that would benefit that path.
        </p>
        <p class="p-bio">
            My interest career wise wasn't always in tech. I originally began my career path by pursuing a nursing degree in college while working in a pharmacy for experience with a plan to eventually go to med school. Luckily, my work in the pharamcy helped me realize despite my interest in medical science, the field and work conditions were not suited for me as a job.
